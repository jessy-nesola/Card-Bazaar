            It's fast, small, can run on browser, edge and cloud. It can handle
            large data. It can run in-memory like redis or disk like sqlite and
            it can run multi-cluster. It can sync between cloud and edge. And to
            top of it off, it can also run as a graphdb. It's interesting.
